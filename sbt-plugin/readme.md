An sbt plugin that extracts the type relationships and call graph of all projects included in an sbt build, using the compiler plugin included with this repo.

This code has initially been based on the [scoverage sbt plugin](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage), to which I am greatly indebted.
